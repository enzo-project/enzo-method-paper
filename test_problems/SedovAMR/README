Notes from Elizabeth Tasker:

SedovBlastAMR.enzo: The parameter file for the Sedov problem. The only
change from the one in the general Enzo runs directory is that the AMR
level is 4, not 2. I found the results with 2 AMR levels not so good.

sedov.py is the analytical solution to the sedov problem (the same as
the IDL file I sent you, but python-ated). It outputs sedov.in that
gives radius, density, pressure, velocity, temperature and internal
energy.

sedov_slice.py does what it says on the tin; one density slice.

The actual plots I've put in the paper I made with xmgrace, so I've
attached two scripts which I can change / merge / etc depending on
what you want. The ones you now have are:

sedov_outputdata.py which outputs the data from a simulation into a
file like sedov.in.  sedov_plot.py plots the radially averaged density
profile from a simulation along with the analytical result from
sedov.in.
