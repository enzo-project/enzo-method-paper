In order to run the IonizationBalance test, you must download and 
install the wrapper to the Enzo chemistry and cooling library, 
known as the Grackle, from https://grackle.readthedocs.org.  The 
Grackle allows one to run the chemistry and cooling solver externally 
from Enzo, which is how the IonizationBalance test was done.  This test
does not run with the test runner.

Follow the instructions on the site above to compile and install the 
Grackle (https://grackle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Installation.html).  
Then, follow the instructions for "Installing the Python Wrappers" in 
https://grackle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Python.html .  After all this 
has been completed, the ionization balance test can be run with:

python enzo_paper_equilibrium_figure.py
