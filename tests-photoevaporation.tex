\subsubsection{Photo-evaporation of a dense clump}
\label{sec.tests.raytracing}

The photo-evaporation of dense clumps of gas is prevalent in radiation
hydrodynamics simulations, and this test problem examines the
ionization front propagation into a dense clump, shadowing effects
behind the clump, and the hydrodynamic response on the clump from
photo-heating, all using \enzo's Moray ray-tracing module.  The
problem setup is the same as Test 7 in the Cosmological Radiative
Transfer Comparison Project \citep{IlievEtAl2009} and
\citet{Wise11_Moray}.  The simulation domain is 6.6~kpc on a side with
an ambient medium of pure neutral hydrogen of density $n_{\rm H} =
2 \times 10^{-4}\; \cubecm$ and temperature $T = 8000 \unit{K}$.  We
place a spherical overdensity in hydrostatic equilibrium with the
ambient medium.  It has a radius $r = 0.8 \unit{kpc}$, hydrogen
density $n_{\rm H} = 0.04\ \cubecm$, and temperature $T = 40$ K, and
is centered at $(x,y,z) = (5, 3.3, 3.3) \unit{kpc}$.
In \citet{IlievEtAl2009} all of the codes used a fixed $128^3$ grid to
ease the comparison, but in this test to demonstrate a higher
resolution AMR solution, we employ a $128^3$ grid with two additional
levels of refinement for cells with a baryon mass greater than 1.5
(method 2 in Section~\ref{sec:refinement_criteria}). This test is run
for 15 Myr.

This cloud is subject to radiation from a point source at the center
of the $x=0$ boundary with an ionizing photon luminosity
$\dot{N}_\gamma = 3 \times 10^{51}$ photons s$^{-1}$, corresponding to
a flux $F_0 = 10^6 \unit{photons s}^{-1} \unit{cm}^{-2}$ at the clump
surface closest to the radiation source.  The radiation source has a
spectrum of a $T = 10^5 \unit{K}$ blackbody, and we use four energy
groups with the following mean energies and relative luminosities:
$E_i = (17.98, 31.15, 49.09, 76.98) \unit{eV}, L_i/L = (0.23, 0.36,
0.24, 0.06)$ that are optimized to reduce errors in the solutions with
a full spectrum and energy discretization \citep{Mirocha12}.
(Note that this choice of energy groups is different from Wise \& Abel 2011.) \nocite{Wise11_Moray}  We use a minimum angular resolution of 10 rays
per cell and a constant radiative transfer timestep of 25 kyr.  Figure
\ref{fig:shadowing} depicts the clump at $t = 15$ Myr with the
outer layers expanding after being photo-heated.  It also shows the
sharp shadowing effects of the dense clump in the neutral fraction
plot that is representative of ray tracing techniques.

simulation.  A point source of radiation is at the center of the -x
boundary and illuminates the clump with a constant luminosity, casting
a clear shadow behind the clump, as seen in the neutral hydrogen
fraction.}
