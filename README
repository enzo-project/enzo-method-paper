Instructions for compiling the paper: Make sure that you have access to latex and
bibtex.  All of the bibliography stuff is in ms.bib (you can get bibtex info
off of ADS, I highly recommend it).  "make" will compile the paper.  "make clean"
will clean out all of the random unnecessary files in the directdory.  Email 
Brian (oshea@msu.edu) if you have any questions.
