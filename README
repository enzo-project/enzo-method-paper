Instructions for compiling the paper:  Make sure that you have access to latex and
bibtex.  All of the bibliography stuff is in ms.bib (you can get bibtex info
off of ADS, I highly recommend it).  The "cleandir.bat" script cleans out all 
of the random unnecessary files out of the directory, and "makepaper.bat" will 
compile the paper with all of the bibtex stuff.  Email bwoshea@lanl.gov if you 
have any questions.
