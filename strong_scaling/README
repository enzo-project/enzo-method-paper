All of these scaling tests were performed on NICS / Kraken.

Cores  	     Cores/node
-----------------------
128	     1
256	     2
512	     4
1024	     4
2048	     8
4096	     8
8192	     8
16384	     8

Because this 512^3 AMR simulation had ~300k grids, the memory overhead
for the hierarchy data was too large and did not allow the simulation
to be run with 12 cores/node.
