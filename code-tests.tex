The Sedov Blast Test \citep{Sedov1959} models an intense explosion, initiated by depositing thermal energy into a homogenous distribution of gas. The result is a strong spherical shock wave centered on the point of energy injection.  This problem is a popular test of astrophysical numerical codes for three reasons: Firstly, it is particularly appropriate to astrophysics since it represents the situation when a supernovae explosion occurs. Secondly, it has an exact analytical solution whereby the shock front's radial position is given by:

\begin{equation}
r(t) = \left(\frac{E_0}{\alpha\rho_0}\right)^{1/5}t^{2/5}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $E_0$ is the initial energy injection, $\rho_0$ is the background density and $\alpha = 1.0$ for cylindrical symmetry and an ideal gas with $\gamma = 1.4$. For the full derivation see \citet{Sedov1959}. This solution makes it possible to assess how well the code performs. Thirdly, the spherical shock is a challenging problem for numerical codes (both grid and particle) since the shock wave increases in size as the simulation progresses and its symmetrical nature highlights any directional preferences that grid codes can succumb to. The test presented here is the two-dimensional version that is included in the Enzo distribution. The three-dimensional results from this test, both for Enzo and three other leading astrophysics codes, can be founds in \citet{Tasker2008}.

In the initial state, the box contains a homogenous distribution of gas at a density of 1 (note that, in the absense of gravity, this problem is scale-free and so without units). Thermal energy is deposited into a single cell at the center of the box with $E_0 = 10.0$. The problem is completed in two dimensions with reflecting boundary conditions (the default for Enzo) and uses a boxsize of side $1$. For this problem, we selected a top grid of $100 \times 100$ and four levels of refinement, placed based on shock location and the slope in density and total energy (this corresponds to cell flagging methods 1 and 3 in the Enzo parameter file). The exception to this scheme is in the initial conditions where grids are placed directly around the injection point. The results were assessed at $t = 0.07$, which corresponding to a time just before the shock reaches the box edge (see Figure~\ref{fig.sedov1}).

Figure~\ref{fig.sedov2} shows the radial profiles for the simulation run with the PPM hydro-solver (blue dashed line) and the Zeus hydro-solver (red dash-dot-dot line) together with the analytical solution (black solid line). Clockwise from the top-left are density, velocity, internal energy and pressure. PPM matches the analytical solution extremely well for all quantities. However, Zeus' shock front lags behind the analytical position. This can also be seen in the slices shown in Figure~\ref{fig.sedov1}. The cause of this discrepancy is that Zeus shows a substantial energy lost during the first few timesteps and produces a diamond-shaped, rather than spherical, shockfront during this time. After this, the code correctly conserves energy but this intial energy loss remains clearly visible in the position of the shock at $t = 0.07$. This problem was addressed directly by \citet{Clarke2010}, who attributed the source of the issue to this version of Zeus solving the internal, rather than total, energy equation. In situations with strong energy gradients, this choice caused an energy loss and the artificial viscosity produces the direction-dependent shockfront shape. In their paper, \citet{Clarke2010} presents results from an alternative version of Zeus that conserves total energy. This problem is less marked for smaller energy gradients and it should be noted that Zeus' stability and speed make it a highly competitive choice, despite the disagreements in this test.

\subsubsection{MHD: Orszag-Tang Vortex}
\label{sec.tests.mhd}
Figure \ref{fig.orszag} shows the Orszag-Tang vortex problem, a typical test
problem for MHD \citep{Orszag79}.  The left panel shows the MHD-CT result, while
the right panel shows the Dedner result.  This test shows that small scale structure
can be generated in MHD from large scale initial perturbations.  
The test begins 
with uniform density, $\rho_0=25/36 \pi$ and pressure, $P_0=5/12 \pi$.  There is
a single rotational mode in the velocity, and two in the magnetic field: 
${\bf v}_0 $ = (-sin(2$\pi$ y) $ \hat{x}$ , sin(2$\pi$ x) $\hat{y}$),
${\bf B}_0$  =  (-sin(2 $\pi$ y) $ \hat{x},$ sin( 4 $\pi$ x )$\hat{y}$).  The
simulation is evolved to t=0.48.  One can see that the structures are accurately
represented as compared to, for instance, \citet{Toth00}, and that the
resolution of shocks is comparable in both methods.  

{\emph Dave's note:  I'll probably play around with these results in future
versions.}

\subsubsection{One-zone collapse test}
\label{sec.tests.1-zone}
The one-zone collapse test simulates the collapse of a
self-gravitating gas cloud using a semi-analytic model for the
evolution of gas density and adiabatic heat input as a function of
time.  It is designed to test the chemistry and cooling modules over a
wide range in densities and over physically motivated timescales.
Because this test disables the hydrodynamic and gravity solvers and
uses a simple model for the density evolution, it is far faster than
running a true collapse simulation.  The density evolution is based on
the self-similar Larson-Penston \citep{1969MNRAS.145..271L,
  1969MNRAS.144..425P} solution for isothermal collapse with a
modification to account for the efficiency with which the heat
introduced by compression can be radiated away
\citep{1983ApJ...265.1047Y}.  Our implementation, described briefly
here, follows the work of \citet{2005ApJ...626..627O}, which one
should consult for further details.  The density evolution is given by 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\rho}{dt} = \frac{\rho}{t_{col}},
\end{equation}
where the collapse timescale, $t_{col}$, is
\begin{equation} \label{eqn.tcol}
t_{col} = \frac{t_{dyn}}{\sqrt{1 - f}},
\end{equation}
and $t_{dyn}$ is the dynamical time, expressed as
\begin{equation}
t_{dyn} = \sqrt{\frac{3 \pi}{32 G \rho}}.
\end{equation}
The collapse timescale is altered from the dynamical time by the
factor, $f$ in Equation \ref{eqn.tcol}, which an approximation of the
ratio of the pressure to the force of gravity.  The value of $f$
depends on the effective adiabatic index, $\gamma_{ef} \equiv (\partial
ln\ p / \partial ln\ \rho)$, which we calculate by linearly extrapolating
from derivative values for the two previous timesteps.  For the value
of $f$, we use the piecewise function of \citet{2005ApJ...626..627O},
given by
\begin{equation}
f = \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
  0, & \gamma_{ef} < 0.83,\\
  0.6 + 2.5 (\gamma_{ef} - 1) - 6.0 (\gamma_{ef} - 1)^{2}, & 0.83 <
  \gamma_{ef} < 1,\\
  1.0 + 0.2 (\gamma_{ef} - 4/3) - 2.9 (\gamma_{ef} - 4/3)^{2}, & \gamma_{ef} > 1.}
\end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
The specific energy evolves as
\begin{equation}
\frac{de}{dt} = -p \frac{d}{dt} \frac{1}{\rho} - \Lambda,
\end{equation}
where $\Lambda$ is the cooling rate in units of erg s$^{-1}$ g$^{-1}$
and energy, temperature, density, and pressure are related by the
ideal gas law.  Figure \ref{fig.onezone} shows an example of the
one-zone collapse test performed with an initial number density of 1
cm$^{-3}$ and temperature of 100 K using the 12 species chemistry
network with H, D, and He species and metal cooling rates calculated
with Cloudy.
